    "p": "2 years of Architectural Engineering from a community college and changed degree to computer programming towards the end of it because I didnâ€™t see myself enjoying that degree to the fullest. Ended up loving computer programming because of the fac that I love video games and one day aspire to be able to create my own and this drew out the fantasy. Transferred to University of Toledo towards the end of the program"
