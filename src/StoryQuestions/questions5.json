    "p": "It doesn’t really have much to do with my story but one of the times when  I was going to donate blood; a nurse that was prepping me to make sure my vitals were good didn’t have a stethoscope. She ended up using just her index and middle fingers on my wrist and a watch to get my pulse; she told me that my heart skipped 16 beats in a minute and I should get it checked out before donating again. Ended up getting a holter monitor and CT scan to make sure everything was fine. Turned out that I have what he called a CV Block (not 100% sure i remember this correctly) but my heart has an irregular heartbeat and it is also partially enlarged."
