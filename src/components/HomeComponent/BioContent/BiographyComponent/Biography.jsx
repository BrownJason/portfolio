            Jason Brown was raised in Wayne, MI, a suburb of Detroit. He was
            an avid gamer and reader from a young age; where he would pursue
            the creative side of video games, reading, and learning to draw.
            He gained interest in coding through playing videos at his
            grandparents place on the weekends with his cousins. While in
            college, pursuing an Computer Science degree, he self-studied
            programming languages to help purse creating video games. Jason
            enrolled in the FastTrackâ€™D program to jumpstart his career in
            this ever exciting and expanding field. In his free time, he
            enjoys gaming with friends, contemplating how game logic is coded,
            bowling and golfing with family, and donating to charity.
