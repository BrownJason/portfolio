            Jason Brown was raised in Wayne, MI, a suburb of Detroit. He was an
            avid gamer and reader from a young age; where he would pursue the
            creative side of video games, reading, and learning to draw. He
            gained interest in coding through playing videos at his grandparents
            place on the weekends with his cousins. While in college, pursuing
            an Computer Science degree, he self-studied programming languages to
            help pursue creating video games. Jason enrolled in the FastTrackâ€™D
            program to jumpstart his career in this ever exciting and expanding
            field. In his free time, he enjoys gaming with friends,
            contemplating how game logic is coded, bowling and golfing with
            family, and donating to charity.
